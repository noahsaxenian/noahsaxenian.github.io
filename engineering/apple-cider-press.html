                            <p>The frame was constructed using wood and sheet metal brackets. I manufactured the top plate out of 1/2 inch steel by first cutting to length on the bandsaw and then drilling and tapping each of the holes.</p>
                            <p>During first tests of the press, the bottom plate flexed significantly under load — a major design flaw. I realized we could stiffen the bottom easily by screwing 2x4's underneath.</p>

                            <p>I cut the shaft from a length of 7/8" threaded rod. I used the lathe to turn the threads off the bottom and sharpened it to a point to reduce friction with the press block. We sandwiched the top aluminum square between several nuts to keep it secure. The bolts sticking out the top allow for any long and stiff item to be used for mechanical advantage.</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Many improvements could be made to this design for a future version. Firstly, the frame is poorly designed. Simply extending the side supports below the bottom plate would allow for secure and easy mounting of 2x4's underneath, greatly increasing the overall stiffness of the frame and allowing it to take more force. Additionally, diagonal braces would be a useful addition to the frame as it has a tendency to rack under large loads. The collection tray is another area for improvement, as the current design leaks without the aid of silicone. A rivet-less, deformed design could be a way to minimize leaks.</p>
            <p>We noticed the steel bar on top deforming during our tests. With a rough measurement of displacement and some calculations we determined a max load of around 6kN.</p>
            <p>This project was a great demonstration of fabrication techniques we learned throughout the course as well as an opportunity for me to pursue my interest in more advanced techniques such as using the manual mill and lathe. The result was a working press, that we used to make and enjoy several cups of apple cider.</p>
