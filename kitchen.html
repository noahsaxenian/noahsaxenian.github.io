            <h2>Artist's Statement</h2>
            <p>
                After experimenting with many different painting styles over the course of this semester, I knew I wanted to depict a realistic scene for my final project. I wanted the scene to have significance to me, so I chose the hut where I so loved working this summer, filled with people who are very dear to me. I used a black and white film photo I had taken as a reference, but made creative choices about the lighting with the goal of filling the room with warmth, which reflects my memory of the space.
            </p>    
            <p>
                Stylistically, I am most drawn to somewhat impressionistic paintings. I was inspired after completing a master study of Sargent’s <i>Femme en Barque</i> to experiment with how my brushstrokes could imply different objects. After completing an accurate drawing and underpainting, I did my best to not get caught up in small details, but rather use larger brush strokes and rich colors to develop the painting.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have spent countless hours in this kitchen. The people both in the painting and in the room (but not the painting) are so important to me. Even just spending time in the location of the hut itself had a large impact on my life. For these reasons, this painting is so significant to me. I am proud of many aspects of this work and I also feel that there are many places that need more attention and time. Overall, I think it is a good representation of all that I have learned this semester.
