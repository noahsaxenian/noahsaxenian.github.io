                    <p>Attempting to bend the sides of my mandolin was a difficult, as I didn’t have access to the proper tool for the job. However, I managed to make it work using a heat gun.</p>

                    <p>I initially tried setting up a pot of boiling water to funnel into a long section of PVC pipe. The wood was placed in the pipe, and the idea was that the steam would soften the wood enough to be clamped in the mold to harden.</p>
                    <p>This failed miserably. The wood got wet and warped, and too much moisture is something you definitely want to avoid. The pipe I was using was also not the right material — it got soft and smelled bad, so I declared that attempt a failure.</p>

            <h2>Using a Heat Gun</h2>
            <div class="content-row" style="--col-a: 3fr; --col-b: 1fr;">
                <div class="content-text">
                    <p>I learned that heat and moisture both play a role in softening the fibers of the wood to bend, so I set a heat gun on the counter and bent the wood by hand. I would gently wet the surface of the wood where I wanted it to bend and then heat while applying bending force with my hands until the fibers started to give. I worked slowly to get the piece close to the shape of the mold, then clamped it overnight to cool and dry completely.</p>
