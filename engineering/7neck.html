            <h2>Carving the Mortise and Tenon</h2>
            <div class="content-row" style="--col-a: 2.5fr; --col-b: 1fr;">
                <div class="content-text">
                    <p>The neck joint was one of the more intimidating parts of this project. It is common to use a dovetail joint for this application, but having little experience with cutting joints like these, I went with a slightly simpler mortise and tenon.</p>
                    <p>I had cut the mortise out of the neck block before gluing the body closed. I used a table saw to cut the tenon close to its final dimension and then hand sanded and filed to the final fit. I had to make many minor adjustments to get the alignment as perfect as possible.</p>
                    <p>A tenon joint is only really strong if it is really tight, and my joint was only pretty tight in the end. I decided to use dowels to reinforce it.</p>

                    <p>One dowel runs in line with the neck, as shown to the right. This helps with alignment and the tight fitting holes create a better glue joint than the tenon itself.</p>

            <h2>Gluing and Reinforcing the Joint</h2>
            <p>One more incredibly stressful glue-up later, and I had the neck attached to the body! I was still concerned about the immense bending forces on the neck joint that are caused by the string tension, so I decided to reinforce it further.</p>
            
            <div class="image-grid-3">
                <div class="content-text">
                    <p>Four dowels were inserted vertically, with the holes drilled small enough that they had to be pressed in with a vice. The dowels cross the edge of the mortise and tenon joint, and their glue surface is incredibly strong since they are pressed in so tightly. I believe this greatly improved the strength of the joint.</p>
